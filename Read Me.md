# FEM Project – Torsion Analysis of Circular, Elliptical, and Triangular Sections  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project investigates the torsional behavior of different cross-sections (circular, elliptical, triangular) using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in Abaqus.  
The aim is to study how geometry affects shear stress distribution, angle of twist, and warping phenomena under torsional loads.  

The project includes:  
1. Geometry creation for different cross-sections.  
2. Material property assignment (ASTM A36 steel).  
3. Mesh generation and verification.  
4. Application of torsional boundary conditions and loads.  
5. Extraction of stress, strain, displacement, and warping results.  
6. Validation and comparison of results across different sections.

## 📐 Methodology  

### 1. Geometry Modeling  
- Created 3D deformable parts (circular, elliptical, triangular bars).  
- Added end grips to apply torsional loads uniformly.  

### 2. Material Properties  
- Used ASTM A36 steel.  
- Young’s Modulus = 210 GPa, Poisson’s Ratio = 0.3.  

### 3. Assembly & Boundary Conditions  
- Added grips at both ends of bars.  
- One end fixed, torsional rotation applied at the other end.  
- Two cases: +10 rad and -10 rad rotations.  

### 4. Meshing & Verification  
- Conducted mesh convergence studies.  
- Circular: optimal mesh = 40 seeds.  
- Elliptical: optimal mesh = 60 seeds.  
- Triangular: optimal mesh = 40 seeds.  

### 5. FEM Simulation (Abaqus)  
- Defined static general step.  
- Applied torsional loading via reference points and coupling constraints.  
- Solved using Abaqus standard solver.  

### 6. Post-Processing  
- Extracted von Mises stress, shear stresses (S13, S23), and displacement (U3).  
- Visualized deformed shapes and torsion-induced warping.

## 📊 Results  
- Circular section: Uniform shear stress distribution, no warping.  
- Elliptical section: Non-uniform stress, warping observed due to asymmetry.  
- Triangular section: Highest stress concentration at sharp corners, strong warping.  
- Mesh convergence confirmed model validity.
